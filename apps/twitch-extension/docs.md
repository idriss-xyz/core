# Twitch extension

#### All instructions assume you are in the root directory of a monorepo - so make sure you are using the console in the correct directory before taking any steps.

## 1. Localhost usage

#### As a first step, you need to install dependencies using

```bash
pnpm install
```

&nbsp;

#### Then, for development purposes, you can use the :dev command

```bash
pnpm twitch-extension:dev
```

This command will start a localhost server at the URL http://localhost:3000 (If other applications on your device are using port `:3000`, it will use the next available port, e.g., `:3001`).

&nbsp;

#### Or use the :prod command for production purposes

```bash
pnpm twitch-extension:prod
```

This command will create a `dist` directory inside your twitch-extension app directory. You then need to manually pack all files from this directory into a ZIP file to make them ready for upload to Twitch servers.

#### Usage

In this step, you need to decide whether you're using [local test](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/life-cycle/#local-test) or [hosted test](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/life-cycle/#twitch-cdn--hosted-test).

1. Start localhost using the :dev command **(Only for local test)**
2. Build files using the :prod command and pack them into a ZIP file **(Only for hosted test)**
3. Switch to the 'Files' tab **(Only for hosted test)**
4. Select the ZIP file with your assets **(Only for hosted test)**
5. Click the `Upload assets` button **(Only for hosted test)**
6. Switch to the 'Status' tab
7. Click `View on Twitch and Install`
8. Click `Install`
9. Click `Activate` and select the type of extension (Only the panel is visible without starting a stream)
10. Click `Configure` and update your wallet address in the extension
11. The extension should now be visible on your profile
